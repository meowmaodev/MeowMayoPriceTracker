I'm not very good at this stuff.

The idea here was to make a small tracker to look up item prices for MeowMayo. This does in fact do that! The issue is im lazy and do not want to implement an actual profit tracker (R.E. i dont want to pay for it) if you would like to, you are free to host this yourself and make your own profit tracker!

If someone wants to pay for a VPS or something to run this let me know and I will make price tracker public :D
